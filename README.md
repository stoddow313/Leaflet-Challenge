# Leaflet-Challenge

## Background: 

For this assignment, we were tasked with utilizing the USGS earthquake data to create a map of all the earthquakes in the last 7 days. While doing so, we were to color code the  depth of each earthquake, and display our marker sizes based on the magnitude. There was an optional part 2 of this assignment, but I did not include it in this as I didn't have time to properly finish. But in my code that is located under Leaflet Part 1, you will find all the necessary information has been loaded in and properly made. 

## Instructions: 
Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization


Your first task is to visualize an earthquake dataset. Complete the following steps:

Get your dataset. To do so, follow these steps:

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON FeedLinks to an external site. page and choose a dataset to visualize.


When you click a dataset (such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days"), you will be given a JSON representation of that data. Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.


Import and visualize the data by doing the following:

Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

Hint: The depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.

Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

Your visualization should look something like the preceding map.

All code was made by following examples from in class activities done with the UO Data Analytics bootcamp. Colors for the markers were made by following the codes on https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp. Only part 1 was done so the index.html provided only links to that part and should have the proper map associated with it.
